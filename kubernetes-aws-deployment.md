# Kubernetes on AWS using a CI/CD pipeline.

This **BLUEPRINT** work exemplifies a step-by-step guide for deploying an application to Kubernetes on AWS using a CI/CD pipeline. It uses GitHub Actions as the CI/CD tool, AWS EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) for Kubernetes, and Docker for containerization. The process includes building the Docker image, pushing it to AWS ECR (Elastic Container Registry), and deploying it to EKS.
